- I have done slight modifications, so tests can run against `Hacker News` website.

Commands
    
    //start selenium-hub with chrome and firefox nodes
    $ npm start
    
    //builds NW docker image, runs container which internally runs nightwatch tests against the hub.
    //npm test

# A Dockerized Selenium Grid with Nightwatch

I built this project to quickly provision a dockerized environment for running
UI tests against a dockerized app. It employs a dockerized [Selenium Grid][grid]
which yields a far more cost-effective CI solution compared to purchasing and
maintaining dedicated machines.

This project is geared toward a Node.js audience, meaning I've included `npm`
scripts as wrappers for the `docker-compose` commands. Hopefully, once you've
completed the initial setup, you won't have to recall any docker commands.
:smiley:

Nightwatch serves as the testrunner. It is automatically provisioned in the
`nightwatch` docker image, which you can easily customize in the included
`nightwatch.json` file.

## Dependencies (OSX)

-   a copy of this repo on your machine
-   homebrew package manager: <http://brew.sh/>
-   docker, docker-machine, and docker-compose:

```sh
brew install docker docker-machine docker-compose
```

-   optional extras to make your life easier: [dinghy][dinghy]

## Dependencies (Linux)

-   a copy of this repo on your machine
-   [docker and docker-compose][docker]
-   optional extras to make your life easier: [dory][dory]

### A note on dinghy and dory

`dinghy` and `dory` are excellent Docker utilities for MacOSX and Linux,
respectively. They simplify your dockerized development workflow in multiple
ways, perhaps the most convenient of which is this: instead of viewing your
dockerized web app in your browser with `http://$(docker-machine ip):<port>`,
you can simply go to `http://myapp.docker`.

*Both `dinghy` and `dory` are optional dependencies, and one may certainly use
the bare-bones Docker ecosystem (and this project) without them.*

## Setup

Here's the default workflow when writing Nightwatch tests in this project:

-   `bin/build && bin/start && bin/test`
-   make changes to files inside the tests/ directory
-   verify changes with `bin/build && bin/start && bin/test`

:sadtrombone:

To make your life easier, first do this:

```sh
cp docker-compose.dev.override.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```

Now any changes you make within this repo on your host file system will
automatically show up in the `nightwatch` docker container. Here's your new
workflow:

-   `bin/build && bin/start && bin/test`
-   make changes to files inside the tests/ directory
-   `bin/test`

:party:

Some folks have reported file permission issues with this workflow, so YMMV.

### Where do I add my app?

By default this project will use [a bare-bones Sinatra web app][app]
as the system under test (SUT). If you want to replace that default web app with
your own, open the `docker-compose.yml` file, find the `web` service
configuration, and replace `mycargus/hello_docker_world:latest` with your app's
docker image label.

For example:

```yaml
web:
  image: my-app-under-test:latest
```

If you're using `dinghy` or `dory`, be sure to define the SUT's virtual URL (a
default is provided). For example:

```yaml
web:
  image: my-app-under-test:latest
  environment:
    VIRTUAL_HOST: myapp.docker
```

That was easy!

If you're not sure how to create or pull a docker image, I recommend working
through the official Docker tutorial located on their website.

## How do I execute the tests?

Start the Selenium hub, the SUT, and the Selenium browser nodes:

```sh
$ npm start
```

Execute the tests with Nightwatch:

```sh
$ npm test
```

When you're done, stop and remove the docker containers:

```sh
$ npm stop
```

Alternatively, if you don't want to install Node on your native machine, you may
use the included `bin/` scripts. For example:

```sh
bin/start
bin/test
bin/stop
```

## I want to see the app under test. How can I do that?

Open your browser and go to <http://hello.docker>. Easy!

If you changed the value of `VIRTUAL_HOST` for the web service in your
docker-compose.yml config, then you'll want to open that URL instead.

## Can I view the Selenium grid console?

Yep! After having started the Selenium hub and nodes (`$ npm start`), open a
browser and go to <http://selenium.hub.docker>, then click the 'console' link.

## A test is failing. How do I debug it?

Start the Selenium hub, the app under test, and the Selenium *debug* browser
nodes:

```sh
$ npm run debug_start
```

View the chrome debug node via VNC (password: `secret`):

```sh
$ open vnc://node.chrome.debug.docker
```

View the firefox debug node via VNC (password: `secret`):

```sh
$ open vnc://node.firefox.debug.docker
```

Next execute the Nightwatch tests against the debug nodes:

```sh
$ npm run debug_test
```

Again, if you don't want to install Node on your native machine, you may use the
included `bin/` scripts:

```sh
bin/debug_start
bin/debug_test
```
